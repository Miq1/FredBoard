## The LED buttons mod
This modification will replace the top row buttons of the Theoryboard by RGB LED-lit ones the FredBoard firmware is controlling.
Initially the left button row is serving as a reference of the note colors, whereas the right button row will indicate the color of the currently selected root note.
