## The Top Row Mod
The choice of colors, font and haptics for the top row buttons (sensors in fact) of the original Irijule design was not optimal as far as I am concerned.
I hardly could read the buttons, especially in darker environments and the cavities were too deep to please me.
So it is time for another mod.

### This mod requires some making skills - you have been warned!
To replace the top row buttons we will need to remove the old panels, print new buttons from TPU on a 3D printer at least.
The planned lighting add-on additionally requires some soldering.

### Bill of materials
We will need:
- a **plastic spatula** to lift off the original panels
- a **hot air** gun or reflow workstation is helpful
- a **3D printer**, ideally an **IDEX** one that is able to print two filaments at a time.
- two contrasting colors of **TPU filament**.
