### FredBoard
FredBoard is an alternative firmware for the Irijule TheoryBoard written by [frudah](https://github.com/Frudah). It has no connection with the original Irijule firmware but was written from scratch. While using the same hardware it has a number of additional features not found in the original.

While FredBoard is closed software for now, this repository is targeting at user exchange, additional (hardware) modifications and bug tracking.
